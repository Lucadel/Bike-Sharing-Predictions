A UTT Machine learning project that consists in predicting the number of bike remaining at a station at a given hour of the day.
The transport habits of citizens reveals a quadratic trend over the day with a peak at 8 am and 6pm.
In order to make the model capture this valuable information, we created quadratic terms on the basis of the hour in the day.
This project includes:
-Data preprocessing
-Feature engineering
-Data visualization
-Polynomial regression.
